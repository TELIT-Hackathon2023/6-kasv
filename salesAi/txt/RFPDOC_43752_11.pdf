rates during the first year of the term of this Agreement and no additional compensation for overtime, weekend, or holiday work.  Attached hereto is a schedule of names, titles and corresponding hourly billing rates.  (Clearly indicate if any of the employees, proposed by you to perform the requested S ervices are former Authority employees .)  Said schedule shall be the 
basis for determining compensation, subject to audit and shall be updated by you in writing as required until your S ervices under this Agreement are completed. The Authority reserves the 
right of approval of all personnel and billing rates for said personnel performing S ervices under 
this Agreement.  For compensation purposes under this Agreement, no such salary or amount shall exceed the salary or amount received by said personnel or rate customarily billed for a partner or p rincipal as of the effective date of this Agreement unless the Director has been 
notified in advance, in writing, of the increased salary, rate or amount and approves the increase.   
The Consultant shall verify that its employees working under this Agreeme nt are legally present 
and authorized to work in the United States , as per the federally required I -9 Program.  
Furthermore, upon request of the Authority, the Consultant shall furnish, or provide access to the Authority, federal Form I -9 (Employment Eligibility Verification) for each individual hired by 
the Consultant performing S ervices hereunder.  This includes citizens and noncitizens.  
When requesting salary or billing rate adjustments for one or more of its personnel, the Consultant shall submit his/he r name, title, current direct hourly rate or billing rate, proposed 
new direct hourly salary or billing rate, resulting percentage increase, effective date and reason for the requested change setting forth in detail any increased costs to the Consultant of  providing 
the Services under this Agreement that has given rise to the request for increased salary.  For 
adjustments submitted after the effective date of this Agreement it is the intention of the Authority to grant an increase if the Consultant demonstr ates compliance with all of the 
following conditions:  that increases in salary, or partner's or principal's billing rate or amount are a) in accordance with the program of periodic merit and cost of living increases normally 
administered by it, b) warrant ed by increased costs of providing S ervices under this Agreement, 
c) based upon increases in salaries and billing rates that are generally applicable to all of Consultant’s clients and d)  in accordance with the Authority’s salary rate increase policy for the 
current year for Authority employees possessing comparable skills and experience.  If during any 
calendar year, Authority limits are not available to the Consultant in a timely fashion, increases falling within such limits may be approved retroactively , as appropriate. The amount of increase 
in salary or billing rate, if any, to be applicable under this Agreement shall in all cases be finally determined by the Director  or his designee, in his sole and absolute discretion.

performing hazardous duty, actually paid to partners, principals, project/program management or other professional and technical employees for time actually spent by them in the performance of Services  hereunder when such overtime or other premium payments have been demonstrated to 
be in accordance with the Consultant's normal business practice and have been authorized in advance by the Director in writing.  The Project Manager for the Authority shall have the right to authorize and approve premium payments up to a total amount of $1,000 per occasion.  Payments above said total amount will be subject to the prior written authorization of the

 Director.  Such premium payments to supervisory employees, who do not receive such payments 
in the Consultant's normal business practice, will not be given under this Agreement.  
 C. An amount equal to the amounts actually paid to subconsultants hereunder who have 
been retained  by Consultant  after the written approval by the Director.  The Consultant shall 
submit a copy of the terms and conditions of the subconsultant’s compensation (including multiplier, if applicable), as well as an estimate of the number of hours required by the subconsultant to perform his services, as part of any request for approval of the subconsultant. 
 D. The Consultant shall also be compensated at an amount equal to the out -of-pocket 
expense, approved in advance by the Director, necessarily and reasonably incurred and actually 
paid by you in the performance of your S ervices hereunder.  Out -of-pocket expenses are 
expenses that are unique to the performance of your S ervices under this Agreement and generally 
contemplate the purchase of outside ancillary services, except that for the purpose of thi s 
Agreement, out -of-pocket expenses do include amounts for mailing and delivery charges for 
submittal of drawings, specifications and reports; long distance telephone calls; rentals of equipment; travel and local transportation; and meals and lodging on overnight trips.  
Notwithstanding the above, the Authority will pay an amount approved in advance by the Chief Engineer and computed as follows for the reproduction of submittal drawings, specifications and reports:  
1) If the Consultant uses its own facilities to reproduce such documents, an amount 
computed in accordance with the billing rates the Consultant customarily charges for reproduction of such documents on agreements such as this, or  
2) If the Consultant uses an outside vendor for the reproduction of such documents, the 
actual, necessary and reasonable amounts for the reproduction of such documents.   
The Authority will not pay for expenses that are usually and customarily included as part of the Consultant's overhead.  For the purposes of this Agreement out -of-pocket expenses do not 
include amounts for typing, utilization of computer systems, computer aided design and drafting (CADD), cameras, recording or measuring devices, flashlights and other small, portable equipment, safety supplies, phones, telephone calls, electronic messaging including Fax, email and text messaging, or expendable office supplies.  Unless otherwise indicated, required 
insurance is not a reimbursable expense.  
When the Consultant uses his personal vehicle to provide services within
 the Port District, the 
Consultant shall be reimbursed for travel expenses beyond normal commuting costs at a rate not 
higher than the Annual Federal Mileage Reimbursement Rate, as determined by the General Services Administration (GSA) -  http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/100715

auto. 
When the Consultant is asked to provide services outside  the Port District, the actual cost of 
transportation as well as the cost for hotel accommodations  and meals will be reimbursable 
hereunder when approved in advance in writing by the Chief Engineer. If the Consultant chooses 
to travel each day to an assignment, where it would be more economical to take a hotel room near the assignment, the maximum reimbursable travel expenses shall not exceed the daily cost for meals and lodging.  The cost for all meals and lodging on approved overnight trips are

records of the amounts of such salaries and amounts actually paid for the performance of such services and records and receipts of reimbursable expenditures hereunder, and, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, failure to do so shall constitute a  conclusive waiver of

The Authority shall have the right to audit all such records.  
The Authority shall have the right to inspect your records, and those of your subconsultants, pertaining to any compensation to be paid hereunder, such records to be maintained by you and your subconsultants for a period of one year after completion of services to be performed under this Agreeme nt.

rendered, and may terminate this Agreement in whole or in part without cause upon three (3) days notice to you.  You shall have no right of termination as to any services under this Agreement without just cause.  Termination by either party shall be by certified letter addressed 
to the other at its address hereinbefore set forth.  Should this Agreement be terminated in whole or in part by either party as above provided, you shall receive no compensation for  any services

 12. You shall not issue or permit to be issued any press release, advertisement, or literature of 
any kind, which refers to the Authority or to the services performed in connection with this

13. Under no circumstances shall you or your subconsultants communicate in any way with any contractor, department, board, agency, commission or other organization or any person whether governmental or private in c onnection with the s ervices to be performed hereunder except upon

even though in addition to those described herein, even if expressly and duly authorized by the 
Authority, shall be deemed to be rendered under and subject to this Agreement (unless referable to another express written, duly executed agreement by the same parties), whether such additional services are performed prior to, during or subsequent to the s ervices described  herein, 
and no rights or obligations shall arise out of such additional s ervices.  
15. No certificate, payment (final or otherwise), acceptance of any work nor any other act or omission of the Authority or the Director shall operate to release you from any  obligations under 
or upon this Agreement, or to estop the Authority from showing at any time that such certificate, payment, acceptance, act or omission was incorrect or to preclude the Authority from recovering any money paid in excess of that lawfully d ue, whether under mistake of law or fact  or to prevent 
the recovery of any damages sustained by the Authority.

persons whether presently existing or arising in the future and whether presently known to either of the parties to this Agreement or not.  This Agreement sha ll not be construed, however, to 
require the Consultant to obtain for the Consultant and the Authority the right to use any idea, design, method, material, equipment or other matter which is the subject of a valid patent, unless owned by the Consultant, or  subconsultant, or an employee of either. Whether or not your 
Proposal is accepted by the Authority, it is agreed that all information of any nature whatsoever which is in any way connected with the s ervices performed in connection with this Agreement,

Project Management Office without express written authorization of the Director.  The Authority will have  the exclusive right to use or permit the use of them and any ideas or methods 
represented by them for any purpose and at any time without other compensation than that specifically provided for herein.  You agree to contract with your employees for the benefit of the Authority to insure that the Authority has such rights and to give to the Authority or any 
party designated by the Authority all assistance reasonably required to perfect the rights herein 
above stated.  You shall indemnify and hold harmless the Authority against any claims of proprietary rights infringement arising out of such use of your work product. 
19. You shall promptly and fully inform the Director, in writing, of any intellectual property

 21. This Agreement being based upon your special qualifications for the services herein 
contemplated, any assignment, subletting or other transfer of this Agreement or any part hereof or of any moneys due or to become due hereunder without the express consent in writing of the Authority shall be void and of no effect as to the Authority, provided, however, that you may sublet services to subconsultants with the express consent in writing of the Director.  All persons to whom you sublet services, however, shall be deemed to be your agents and no subletting or 
approval thereof shall be deemed to release you from your obligations under this Agreement or to impose any obligation on the Authority to such subconsultant or give  the subconsultant any

22. The Authority has a long -standing practice of encouraging Minority Business Enterprises

business entity which is at least fifty -one percent (51%)  owned by one (1)  or more members of 
one (1)  or more minority groups, or, in the case of a publicly held corporation, at l east fifty -one 
percent (51%) of the stock of which is owned by one (1) or more members of one (1) or more minority groups; and whose management and daily business operations are controlled by one (1) or more such individuals who are citizens or permanent r esident aliens.  "Women- owned

A. Black persons having origins in any of the Black African racial groups not of Hispanic 
origin;  
B. Hispanic persons of Puerto Rican, Mexican, Dominican, Cuban, Central or South 
American culture or origin, regardless of race;  
C. Asian and Pacific Islander persons having origins in any of the ori ginal peoples of the Far 
East, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent or the Pacific Islands;  
D. American Indian or Alaskan Native persons having origins in any of the original peoples 
of North America and maintaining identifiable tribal affiliations through  membership and 
participation or community identification.  
 The Director has set a goal of twelve percent (12%) participation by qualified and certified MBEs and five percent (5%) to qualified and certified WBEs on technical service projects.  
To be "certif ied" a firm must be certified by the Authority's Office of Business Diversity and 
Civil Rights.  
In order to facilitate the meeting of this goal, the Consultant shall use every good- faith effort to 
utilize subconsultants who are certified MBEs or WBEs to th e maximum extent feasible.  
The Authority has a list of certified MBE/WBE service firms which is available to you at http://www.panynj.gov/business -opportunities/supplier -diversity.html
.  The Consultant will be

23. NON -DISCRIMINAT ION REQUIREMENTS

this Contract. Without limiting the generality of any other term or provision of this Contract, in the event the Authority, or a state or federal agency finds that the Consultant or any of its subconsultants or vendors has not complied with these “Non- Discrimination Requirements”, the 
Authority may cancel, terminate or suspend this Contract in accordance with Section 11 of these 
Standard Terms and C onditions    entitled   “Default, Revocation, or Suspension of Contract.”  
C. Consultant agrees to cooperate fully with the Authority’s investigation of allegations of 
discrimination. Cooperation includes, but is not limited to, allowing the Authority to questi on 
employees during the investigation of allegations of discrimination, and complying with directives that the Authority or the State or Federal government deem essential to ensure 
compliance with these “Non -Discrimination Requirements.”

 · Consultant/Subconsultant identity checks and background screening  
The Consultant may be required to have its staff, and any subconsultant’s staff, visitors or others 
over whom the Consultant/subconsultant has control, authorize the Authority or its designee to perform background checks, and a personal identity verifi cation check.  Such authorization shall 
be in a form acceptable to the Authority.  The Consultant and subconsultant may also be required to use an organization designated by the Authority to perform the background checks.   
The Authority’s designated background screening provider may require inspection of not less than two forms of valid/current government issued identification (at least one having an official photograph) to verify staff’s name and residence; screening federal, state, and/or local criminal justice agency information databases and files; screening of any terrorist identification files; access identification to include some form of biometric security methodology such as fingerprint, facial or iris scanning.  
As of January 29, 2007, the Secure Worker Access Consortium (S.W.A.C.) is the only Authority approved provider to be used to conduct background screening and personal identity verification, except as otherwise required by federal law and/or regulation  (such as the Transportation Worker Ide ntification Credential for personnel performing in secure areas at Maritime facilities).  
Information about S.W.A.C., instructions, corporate enrollment, online applications, and location of processing centers is located at http://www.secureworker.com
, or S.W.A.C. can be contacted 
directly at (877) 522- 7922 for more information and the latest pricing. If approved by the Project 
Manager, the cost for said background checks for staff that pass and are granted a creden tial shall 
be reimbursable to the Consultant (and its subconsultants) as an out -of-pocket expense as 
provided herein.  Staff that are rejected for a credential for any reason are not reimbursable.  
· Issuance of Photo Identification Credential  
No person shall  be permitted on or about the non- public areas of the Authority ’s construction 
sites or facilities  (including rental spaces) without a facility -specific photo identification 
credential approved by the Authority.  If the A uthority requires facility -specific identification 
credential s for the Consultant and the subconsultant’s staff, the Authority will supply such 
identification at no cost to the Consultant or its subconsultants.  Such facility -specific 
identification credential shall remain the property of the Authority and shall be returned to the Authority at the completion or upon request prior to completion of the individual’s assignment at the specific facility.  It is the responsibility of the Consultant to immediately report to the Authority the loss of any staff member’s  or subconsultant’s  individual facility -specific 
identification credential. The Consultant will  be billed for the cost of the replacement 
identification credential.  Staff shall display Identification badges in a conspicuous and clearly  
visible manner, when entering, working or leaving an Authority construction site or facility.  
Staff may be required to produce not less than two forms of valid/current government issued identification having an official photograph and an original, non- laminated social security card 
for identify and SSN verification.

on the commencement date.  The description of Secure Areas may be changed from time to time and at any time by the Project Manager during the term of the Agreement .   
· Access control, inspection, and monitoring by security guards  
The Authority may provide for Authority construction site s or facilities  (including rental spaces) 
access control, inspection and monitoring by Port Authority Police or Authority retained Consultant  security guards.  However, this provision shall not relieve the Consultant of its 
responsibility to secure its equipment and wor k and that of its subconsultant s and service 
suppliers at the Authority construction site s or facilities  (including rental spaces).   In addition, 
the Consultant, subconsultant or service provider is not permitted to take photographs, digital images, electronic copying and/or electronic transmission or video recordings or to make 
sketches on any other medium at the Authority constructi on sites or facilities (including rental 
spaces), except when necessary to perform the Work under this Agreement , without  prior 
written permission from the Authority.  Upon request, any photograph, digital images, video recording or sketches made of the A uthority construction site s or facilities  shall be submitted to 
the Authority to determine compliance with this paragraph, which submission shall be 
conclusive and binding on the submitting entity .

(“PI”) as defined in the Port Authority Information Security Handbook (“Handbook”), dated 
October, 2008, corrected as of November 14, 2013;  and as may be fur ther amended.  The 
Handbook and its requirements are hereby incorporated into this A greement and will govern the 
possession, distribution and use of PI if at any point during the lifecycle of the project or solicitation it becomes necessary for the Consult ant to have access to PI . Protecting sensitive 
information requires the application of uniform safeguarding measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure and to control any authorized disclosure of this information within the Authority or when released by th e Authority to outside entities.   The Handbook can be obtained upon request 
or at: http://www.panynj.gov/business -opportunities/pdf/Corporate -Informat ion-Security -

 E. no person or selling agency other than a bona fide employee or bona fide established

 F. the Consultant  has not offered, promised or given, demanded or accepted, any undue

The certifications in this Section and the Section entitled “Certification of No Investigation 
(Criminal or Civil Anti- trust), Indictment, Conviction, Debarment Suspension, Disqualification 
and Disclosure of Other Information”, shall be deemed to be made by the Consultant as follows:   
 
 
 
FIRM             - PAGE 16 - DATE  
  
   * if the Consultant is a corporation, such certification shall be deemed to have been 
made not only with respect to the Consultant itself, but also with respect to each parent, affiliate, 
director, and officer of the Consultant, as well as, to the best of the certifier’s  knowledge and 
belief, each stockholder of the Consultant with an ownership interest in excess of 10%;  
  * if the Consultant is a partnership, such certification shall be deemed to have been 
made not only with respect to the Consultant itself, but also with respect to each partner.  
Moreover  the certifications in this Section and the Section entitled “Certification of No 
Investigation (Criminal or Civil Anti- trust), Indictment, Conviction, Debarment Suspension, 
Disqualification and Disclosure of Other Information”, if made by a corporate Consultant, shall 
be deemed to have been authorized by the Board of Directors of the Consultant, and such authorization shall be  deemed to include the signing and submission of the proposal and the 
inclusion therein of such certification as the act and deed of the corporation. 
In any case where the Consultant cannot make the certifications  in this Section and the Section 
entitled “ Certification of No Investigation (Criminal or Civil Anti- trust), Indictment, Conviction, 
Debarment Suspension, Disqualification and Disclosure of Other Information” , the Consultant 
shall so state and shall furnish with the signed proposal a signed stateme nt, which sets forth in 
detail the reasons therefor.  If the Consultant is uncertain as to whether it can make the foregoing 
certifications, it shall so indicate in a signed statement furnished with its proposal, setting forth in  
such statement the reasons  for its uncertainty.  With respect to the foregoing certification in 
paragraph “2 6G.”, if the Consultant cannot make the certification, it shall provide, in writing, 
with the signed proposal:  (i)  a list of the name(s), address(es), telephone number(s), a nd place(s) 
of principal employment of each such individual or organization; and (ii) a statement as to whether such individual or organization has a “financial interest” in this Agreement , as described 
in the Procurement Disclosure policy of the Authority   (a copy of which is available upon request 
to the Chief  Procurement Officer of the Authority).  Such disclosure is to be updated, as 
necessary, up to the time of award of this Agreement.  As a result of such disclosure, the 
Authority shall take appropri ate action up to and including a finding of non -responsibility.  
Failure to make the required disclosures shall lead to administrative actions up to and including a finding of non -responsibility.  
Notwithstanding that the Consultant may be able to make cert ifications in this Section and the 
Section entitled “Certification of No Investigation (Criminal or Civil Anti- trust), Indictment, 
Conviction, Debarment Suspension, Disqualification and Disclosure of Other Information”  at the time the proposal is submitte d, the Consultant shall immediately notify the Authority in 
writing during the period of irrevocability of proposals on this Agreement or any extension of such period, or during the term of this Agreement, of any change of circumstances which might 
under t his clause make it unable to make the foregoing certifications or require disclosure.  The 
foregoing certifications or signed statement shall be deemed to have been made by the Consultant with full knowledge that they would become a part of the records of the Authority and that the Authority will rely on their truth and accuracy in awarding this Agreement.  In the event that the Authority should determine at any time prior or subsequent to the award of this Agreement that the Consultant has falsely certifie d as to any material item in the foregoing 
certifications or has willfully or fraudulently furnished a signed statement which is false in any material respect, or has not fully and accurately represented any circumstance with respect to any  
 
 
 
FIRM             - PAGE 17 - DATE  
  
 item in the for egoing certifications required to be disclosed, the Authority may determine that the 
Consultant is not a responsible Consultant with respect to its proposal on the Agreement or with 
respect to future proposals on Authority agreements and may exercise such other remedies as are provided to it by the Agreement with respect to these matters. In addition, Consultants are advised that knowingly providing a false certification or statement pursuant hereto may be the basis for prosecution for offering a false inst rument for filing (see, e.g. New York Penal Law, 
Section 175.30 et seq.). Consultants are also advised that the inability to make such certification will not in and of itself disqualify a Consultant, and that in each instance the Authority will evaluate th e reasons therefor provided by the Consultant.   
Under certain circumstances the Consultant may be required as a condition of this Agreement award to enter into a Monitoring Agreement under which it will be required to take certain specified actions, including compensating an independent Monitor to be selected by the Authority. Said Monitor shall be charged with, among other things, auditing the actions of the Consultant to determine whether its business practices and relationships indicate a level of integ rity sufficient to permit it to continue business with the Authority.   
28. CONSULTANT ELIGIBILITY FOR AWARD OF AGREEMENTS -  DETERMINATION 
BY AN AGENCY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR NEW JERSEY CONCERNING ELIGIBILITY TO RECEIVE PUBLIC AGREEMENTS  
Consultants a re advised that the Authority has adopted a policy to the effect that in awarding its 
agreements it will honor any determination by an agency of the State of New York or New Jersey that a Consultant is not eligible to propose on or be awarded public agreem ents because 
the Consultant has been determined to have engaged in illegal or dishonest conduct or to have violated prevailing rate of wage legislation.  
The policy permits a Consultant whose ineligibility has been so determined by an agency of the State of  New York or New Jersey to submit a proposal on an Authority agreement and then to 
establish that it is eligible to be awarded an agreement on which it has proposed because (i) the state agency determination relied upon does not apply to the Consultant, or  (ii) the state agency 
determination relied upon was made without affording the Consultant the notice and hearing to which the Consultant was entitled by the requirements of due process of law, or (iii) the state 
agency determination was clearly erroneous or (iv) the state agency determination relied upon 
was not based on a finding of conduct demonstrating a lack of integrity or violation of a prevailing rate of wage law.  
The full text of the resolution adopting the policy may be found in the Minutes of the  Authority's 
Board of Commissioners meeting of September 9, 1993. 
29. CONSULTANT RESPONSIBILITY, SUSPENSION OF WORK AND TERMINATION  
During the term of this Agreement, the Consultant shall remain responsible .  The Consultant 
agrees, if requested by the Auth ority to present evidence of its continuing legal authority to do 
business in the States of New Jersey or New York, integrity, experience, ability, prior 
performance, and organizational and financial capacity.   
 
 
 
FIRM             - PAGE 18 - DATE  
  
 The Authority, in its sole discretion, reserve s the right to suspend any or all activities under this 
Agreement, at any time, when it discovers information that calls into question the responsibility 
of the Consultant.  In the event of such suspension, the Consultant will be given written notice 
outlining the particulars of such suspension. Upon issuance of such notice, the Consultant shall  
comply with the terms of the suspension order.  Agreement activity may resume at such time as 
the Authority issues a written notice authorizing a resumption of perf ormance under the 
Agreement.  
Upon written notice to the Consultant, and an opportunity to be heard with appropriate Authority officials or staff, the Agreement  may be terminated by the  Authority at the Consultant’ s expense 
where the Consultant is determine d by the Authority to be non- responsible.  In such event, the 
Authority or its designee may complete the contractual requirements in any manner he or she  
may deem advisable and pursue available legal or equitable remedies for breach, including recovery of costs from Consultant associated with such termination. 
30. NO GIFTS, GRATUITIES, OFFERS OF EMPLOYMENT, ETC.  
At all times, the Consultant shall not offer, give or agree to give anything of value either to an  
Authority employee, agent, job shopper, consult ant, construction manager or other person or firm 
representing the Authority, or to a member of the immediate family (i.e., a spouse, child, parent, 
brother , or sister) of any of the foregoing, in connection with the performance by such employee, 
agent, job shopper, consultant, construction manager , or other person or firm representing the 
Authority of duties involving transactions with the Consultant on behalf of the Authority, whether or not such duties are related to this Agreement or any other Authority  agreement  or 
matter.  Any such conduct shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.  
As used herein “ anything of value ” shall include but not be limited to any (a) favors, such as 
meals, entertainment, transportation (other than that contemplated b y the Agreement or any other 
Authority agreement ), etc. which might tend to obligate  or ingratiate  the Authority employee to 
the Consultant, and (b) gift, gratuity, money, goods, equipment, services, lodging, discounts not available to the general public, offers or promises of employment, loans or the cancellation thereof, preferential treatment , or business opportunity.  Such term shall not include 
compensation contemplated by this Agreement or any other Authority agreement.  Where used 
herein, the term  “Port Authority” or  “Authority ” shall be deemed to include all subsidiaries of 
the Authority.  
The Consultant shall e nsure that no gratuities of any kind or nature whatsoever shall be solicited 
or accepted by it and by its personnel for any reason whatsoever f rom the passengers, tenants, 
customers or other persons using the Facility and shall so instruct its personnel. 
In the event that the Consultant  becomes aware of the occurrence of any conduct that is 
prohibited by this section entitled “No Gifts, Gratuitie s, Offers of Employment, Etc.”, it shall 
report such occurrence to the Authority’s Office of Inspector General within three (3) business 
days of obtaining such knowledge.  (See “ http://www.panynj.gov/ins pector -general
” for 
information about  reporting information to the Office of Inspector General).  Failing to report 
such conduct shall be grounds for a finding of non -responsibility.   
 
 
 
FIRM             - PAGE 19 - DATE  
  
 In addition, during the term of this Agreement , the Consultant  shall no t make an offer of 
employment or use confidential information in a manner proscribed by the Code of Ethics  and 
Financial Disclosure dated March 11, 2014, or as may be revised (a copy of which is available 
upon request to the Off ice of the Secretary of the Authority).  Without the express written 
approval of the Director,  you shall keep confidential, and shall require your employees, your 
subconsultants, and your subconsultant’s employees to keep confidential a) all information 
disclosed by the Authority or its consultants to you or b) developed by you or your subconsultants in the performance of services hereunder.  Disclosure of any such information shall constitute a material breach of the Agreement.  
The Consultant  shall include the provisions of this clause in each sub agreement  entered into 
under this Agreement . 
31. CONFLICT OF INTEREST 
During the term of this Agreement, the Consultant shall not participate in any way in the 
preparation, negotiation or award of any agreement (other than an agreement for it s own services 
to the Authority) to which it is contemplated the Authority may become a party, or participate in any way in the review or resolution of a claim in connection with such an agreement if the Consultant has a substantial financial interest in the Consultant or potential Consultant  of the 
Authority or if the Consultant has an arrangement for future employment or for any other business relationship with said Consultant or potential Consultant , nor shall the Consultant at any 
time take any other action which might be viewed as or give the appearance of conflict of interest on its part.   If the possibility of such an arrangement for future employment or for 
another business arrangement has been or is the subject of a previous or current discussion, or if the Consultant has reason to believe such an arrangement may be the subject of future discussion, or if the Consultant has any financial interest, substantial or not, in a Consultant or 
potential Consultant  of the Authority, and the Consultant 's participation in the preparation, 
negotiation or award of any agreement with such a Consultant or the review or resolution of a claim in connection with such an agreement is contemplated or if the Consultant has reason to believe that any other situation exists  which might be viewed as or give the appearance of a 
conflict of interest, the Consultant shall immediately inform the Authority  in writing of such 
situation giving the full details thereof .  Unless the  Consultant receives the specific written 
approval of  the Authority , the Consultant shall not take the contemplated action  which might be 
viewed as or give the appearance of a conflict of interest .  The Authority  may require the 
Consultant to submit a mitigation plan addressing and mitigating any disclosed o r undisclosed 
conflict, which is subject to the approval of the Authority and shall become a requirement, as though fully set forth in this Agreement.  In the event the Authority  shall determine that the 
performance by the Consultant of a portion of its se rvices under this Agreement is precluded by 
the provisions of this numbered paragraph, or a portion of the Consultant’s said services is determined by the Authority  to be no longer appropriate because of such preclusion, then the 
Authority  shall have full authority on behalf of both parties to order that such portion of the 
Consultant’s services not be performed by the Consultant, reserving the  right, however, to have 
the services performed by others and any lump sum compensation payable hereunder which is applicable to the deleted work shall be equitably adjusted by the parties.  The Consultant’s execution of this document shall constitute a representation by the Consultant that at the time of  
 
 
 
FIRM             - PAGE 20 - DATE  
  
 such execution the Consultant knows of no circumstances, present  or anticipated, which come 
within the provisions of this paragraph or which might otherwise be viewed as or give the 
appearance of a conflict of interest on the Consultant’s part.  The Consultant acknowledges that the Authority may preclude it from involv ement in certain disposition/privatization initiatives or 
transactions that result from the findings of its evaluations hereunder or from participation in any agreements, which result, directly or indirectly, from the services provided by the Consultant hereunder. The Authority’s determination regarding any questions of conflict of interest shall be 
final.
